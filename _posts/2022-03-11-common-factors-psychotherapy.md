# What are the common factors underlying all effective psychotherapies?

As a therapist, I have always wondered what _really_ is the role of a therapist. Are we merely the vehicle of delivery? If so, a patient should technically have the same outcome from a book, an online self-paced course, or any other therapist (of course, holding competency stable across mediums). But I think there is more -- I am interested to find out how the therapy relationship plays into mechanisms of change. Although this paper was not exactly what I was looking for, it did give me an overview of the contextual model of psychotherapy and the common factors of psychotherapy.

### How important are the common factors in psychotherapy? An update.

### Abstract:  
*(copy + paste from paper)*  
The common factors have a long history in the field of psychotherapy theory, research and practice. To understand the evidence supporting them as important therapeutic elements, the contextual model of psychotherapy is outlined. Then the evidence, primarily from meta-analyses, is presented for particular common factors, including alliance, empathy, expectations, cultural adaptation, and therapist differences. Then the evidence for four factors related to specificity, including treatment differences, specific ingredients, adherence, and competence, is presented. The evidence supports the conclusion that the common factors are important for producing the benefits of psychotherapy.

### Summary of what the paper says and does:
*(in my own words: Problem, approach, methods, conclusions as stated by the authors)*
The Premise: Wampold argues that therapies work not for the specific modality or "key skills delivered", but that an effective psychotherapy is effective because of a broader set of factors. These are:
- the relationship, which includes the perceived genuineness of the therapist, the therapist's ability to convey empathy and positive regard for the patient
- the expectations around treatment and the patient's acceptance of the explanation of the disorder and how treatment will help
- the doing of health-promoting behaviours during the course of therapy

Wampold tries to argue that specific treatment modalities, when compared against one another have small effect sizes; and that *dismantling designs* where the purported special ingredient of the therapy is taken out doesn't change the efficacy of the therapy much. 

Another point he uses to support his argument is that adherence and competency ratings in clinical trials (by experts on the delivering therapist) does not relate to outcomes. In that, he calls for flexibility in adherence - which is deemed a common factor related to the relationship and the expectations. He also claims that competence ratings generally involve the skill delivered, rather than ratings of warmth or empathy towards the patient.


### Summary of what I thought of the paper:
*(Is it fundamentally sound? Does it uncover anything useful? Did they miss something? What questions are left unanswered?)*

Major critique: The recklessness in converting correlations (of continuous variables) into effect sizes. As a result, I am taking this paper as an opinion piece, rather than see it as adding evidence to either side of the argument.

The common factors all seem to bleed into one another -- how do you dismantle the inter-links of the relationship and the expectations? Although Wampold did reference the threats to validity and the difficulty in assessing objectively these variables, I don't think he was able to provide the evidence to counter those points. For example, to work with the patient to come up with an explanation of the disorder that fits their world view (and cultural background), requires the therapist to have empathy and the ability to elicit from the patient their world views. So, can you have a good, genuine relationship that is empathetic and warm, and then NOT be able to set up the alliance and expectations together in a productive manner?

Merits of the paper: Got me to think deeper about when certain terms are used, what they really refer to. This is in reference to the point about adherence and competency -- you'd think those things should be related to outcome measures, so why are they not? Does each clinical trial measure the same things for competency? 
  
A final thought I had was related to how common factors might translate to online, non-therapist-delivered treatments; i.e. how might user experience of a self-paced course play a similar role to how a therapist facilitates in-person treatment.
