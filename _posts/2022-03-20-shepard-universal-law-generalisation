# On reading seminal papers: Shepard's Universal Law of Generalisation

We rarely ever encounter the same exact situation twice, but we never enter new situations completely blank. How do we generalise our knowledge?

### Toward a Universal Law of Generalisation  
**Author:** Roger N. Shepard   
**Year:** 1987
  
### Abstract:  
*(copy + paste from paper)*  
A psychological space is established for any set of stimuli by determining metric distances between the stimuli such that the probability that a response learned to any stimulus will generalize to any other is an invariant monotonic function of the distance between them. To a good approximation, this probability of generalization (i) decays exponentially with this distance, and (ii) does so in accordance with one of two metrics, depending on the relation between the dimensions along which the stimuli vary. These empirical regularities are mathematically derivable from universal principles of natural kinds and probabilistic geometry that may, through evolutionary internalization, tend to govern the behaviors of all sentient organisms.

### Summary of what the paper says and does:
*(in my own words: Problem, approach, methods, conclusions as stated by the authors)*
The Premise: Shepard argues that the primary law of psychology should be that of generalisation. Generalisation is not merely the failure to discriminate between stimuli, but serves a purpose to extend a learned response from a previous situation to the current. Generalisation occurs when we judge the stimuli as likely to belong to a set of situations that have the same consequence. The degree to which we generalise can be calculated as a monotonic function of the distance between the two stimuli in the psychological space.


### Summary of what I thought of the paper:
*(Is it fundamentally sound? Does it uncover anything useful? Did they miss something? What questions are left unanswered?)*

I don't know about you, but I sometimes find these "classics" very difficult to read. Here's a heading he used: Apparent Noninvariance of Generalisation. Talk about double double negatives? 

The construct of generalisation is at the core of psychotherapy - not only in maladaptive behaviours that generalise from setbacks and traumas; but also in how new skills and ways of being can be transferred from a therapy setting to the rest of one's life and relationships.

I am curious about how the context of which we encounter a stimuli influences how it is categorised in the psychological space and subsequent generalisation. Giving a presentation to friendly colleagues is very different from giving a presentation to the entire department at work - you can easily imagine how one context would still bring about feelings of uncertainty and unfamiliarity; even though the action of "giving a presentation" is the same and much of the behaviours can be generalised.

The next question I have is, beyond context, how does self-efficacy play into the ability to generalise (in this case, I imagine there would be some asymmetry between generalising over setbacks versus new skills). For example, if my therapy patient ascribes progress to themselves and says, "I have learnt through therapy how to calm myself down" - would they generalise adaptive skills faster than the patient that says, "My therapist helps me calm down."?
