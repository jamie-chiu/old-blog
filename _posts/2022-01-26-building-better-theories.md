# How does one build a good theory?

This paper was shared within the lab by Rachel Bedder who was preparing a talk on theory-building. I had just read Rigoli's paper about their reference-dependent model of subjective evaluation and was feeling somewhat dissatisfied at their "explanation" (I kept thinking it was more of a description of an observed phenomena instead) -- hence, this paper caught my eye! I am also unfamiliar with the process of developing a sound theory, and so was interested in what might be a foundational reading to formulate my understanding upon.

### Summary of what the paper says and does:
*(In my own words: Problem, approach, methods, conclusions as stated by the authors)*

Press, Yon, and Heyes articulate 7 questions to prompt scientists to reflect and examine on what really is a theory and how to go about testing one:
1. Is the target appropriate and is it well-defined?  
Too loosely defined, and you run the risk of clumping together unrelated cases that arise from separate mechanisms. The authors also warn not to mistake an effect as a target (this part was not so clearly explained).
2.  Are your predictions driven by theory or empirical data?  
The authors give an example of making predictions based on what similar experiments have found versus making predictions based on an understanding of some mechanism. An example here was predicting that 7 year olds will perform better on a memory test than 5 year olds, based on data of 5 year olds performing better than 3 year olds on the same test; VS predicting that 7 year olds will perform better on a memory test than 5 year olds because of a theory that executive functioning is linked to memory ability and that 7 year olds have been shown to have better executive functioning than 5 year olds. _(again, subtle but different)_
3. Are you developing a theory or a framework?  
Frameworks are defined as broad way of thinking, whereas theories are defined as explanations of phenomenon. Theories live inside frameworks. Example here was Bayesian brain as a framework, and hallucinations arising from strong priors as a theory.
4. Does the theory and data actually explain the target?  
Two pitfalls: Typology instead of explanation, where you are categorising and defining the phenomena rather than explaining; and Circular reasoning / "begging the question" where the premise of your argument (theory) assumes the truth of the conclusion. Example given of using aspects of the phenomena to "explain" the target.
5. Is this actually a new theory or just an old theory being rebranded?  
There is a distinction between reformulation versus developing a new theory. Not to say that reformulations are not useful because new theories can arise from them.
6. What would be the most informative evidence to support or refute this theory?  
The authors here argue for risky testing, where you try to pit theories against one another in the arena where they differ most; in trying to gather data on the theory's most surprising predictions. There's no good in collecting data that supports your theory but also supports 3 other similar theories. You want to gather data that differentiates the theories.
7. When there's a negative result - is it really evidence against the theory, or could it be measurement or methodological inprecision?  
How good are our measurement tools? What assumptions are we not questioning? Are we 100% certain about the causes of negative results? But also, to balance that with a healthy dose of reality checking and letting go of theories that are proven wrong.

**Overall:** Make sure you start with the right question - then consider ways to test your theory that give you '_biggest bang for your buck_' - always be questioning your assumptions, your approaches and tools - and finally, don't get personally defensive for your theories and let it go if they're really wrong.

### Summary of what I thought of the paper:
*(Is it fundamentally sound? Does it uncover anything useful? Did they miss something? What questions are left unanswered?)*

**What I didn't love:**
- I felt the paper was a little too high-level and vague in details.
- While reading it, many of the points made sense -- but when you try to think deeper, it's suddenly not so clear again. For example, I am still unsure what the authors meant when they said not to confuse effect with an explanatory target. I think what throws me off is the use of "explanatory" in front of target; since the term target was earlier defined as the phenomenon you wish to explain. (So, an _explanatory phenomenon you wish to explain_? Hurts my head a little.)  

**What I did like:**
- Highlighted the need to be specific about the terms and labels we use. (theory / hypothesis / model / framework <- yup, looking at you!)
- I also appreciated the reminder to be aware of circular reasoning. This is particularly relevant for explaining depression because it is often the case (albeit unintentional) that a feature of the illness is used to "explain" the illness (and thus, fail to actually answer how or why).

**New idea from this paper:**
- Risky testing, essentially going for the "_biggest bang for your buck_" when it comes to testing your hypothesis. I've never thought about this before, but certainly will be moving forward!
