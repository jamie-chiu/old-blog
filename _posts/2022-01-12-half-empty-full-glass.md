# How we evaluate outcomes depends on the context!

Today, I participated in a Drop-Everything-And-Read day. It felt great to not have any excuses (_oh, I'll just write this email first; let me just get that sorted quickly_) and to actually get stuck into my reading list! I have been meaning to read the following paper for quite some now -- mainly because it had a very catchy title but also I was interested to find examples of how others are developing formal models for psychopathology. (Unfortunately, as you will see below in my personal thoughts, it was a slightly disappointing read).

### The half-empty/full glass in mental health: A reference-dependent computational model of evaluation in psychopathology  
**Authors:** Francesco Rigoli, Cristina Martinelli, Giovanni Pezzulo

### Summary of what the paper says and does:
*(In my own words: Problem, approach, methods, conclusions as stated by the authors)*

The authors proposed a model for calculating how we subjectively evaluate outcomes as good or bad depending on context. The parameters involve a "reference" measure and an "uncertainty" measure - in an adaptive individual, reference would be the average given all possible (contextual) outcomes and uncertainty would be the standard deviation of those contextual outcomes.

The model makes two main arguments -- that when the reference point is too high, it lowers our subjective value of more outcomes (the reverse also applies); and when the uncertainty is too low, it leads to distorted perception of how close/far apart outcomes are (i.e. "bad" and "good" categories become further apart; but outcomes within the category of "bad" become closer together).

The model is then hypothetically applied to different cases of psychopathology, but the two that I found interesting (albeit somewhat contradictory) are depression and drug addiction:  
- **Depression:** depressed individuals are argued to have a reference point that is beyond the set of possible outcomes, so that everything below that reference point is perceived as subjectively bad (which in this case, is everything). Uncertainty is also low so this, the argument goes, explains the dichotomous thinking that happens with depression.  
- **Drug addiction:** After repeated exposure to feeling "high", the reference point shifts upwards and uncertainty goes lower (_you know you will feel good_). The model then says that other activities pale in comparison (subjective value of those go down) and the subjective value of not consuming drugs become way worse leading to onset of withdrawal effects.

### Summary of what I thought of the paper:
*(Is it fundamentally sound? Does it uncover anything useful? Did they miss something? What questions are left unanswered?)*

**Questions that I felt were left unanswered:**
- How does a depressed individual come to have a reference point that is outside of the possible outcomes? The authors allude to a few reasons - genetic predisposition, trauma, etc. but none of them feel satisfying as answers.
    - The authors briefly mention trauma -- acknowledging that it does not match the model's description of depressed individuals having an extreme high reference point; an explanation is attempted to say perhaps it is learning rate that is impaired instead, but I am left unsatisfied as to how an extremely low or high learning rate would lead to an extremely high reference point that goes beyond possible outcomes.
- Why does the reference point change when the authors explain drug addiction, but not for depression? How is this ability to change reference points accounted for by the model (well, it doesn't) but I thought it was a little contradictory that they would say the reference moves up after a few "highs" from taking drugs, but the reference doesn't drop from setbacks in depression?
