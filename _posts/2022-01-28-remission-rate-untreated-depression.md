### What prompted me to read this paper:
*(setting the context; what questions am I thinking, what answers am I looking for?)*
- One area that I am interested in is the phenomena of spontaneous recovery. Getting data on how often that happens seemed like a good starting point.
**Title:**
What is the short-term remission rate for people with untreated depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis

## Abstract:
Background: Depression is one of the prevalent mental illnesses and leading cause of global disease burden. However, most people with depression do not access treatment. Remission without treatment may occur in some cases of depression. This study aimed to estimate the short-term remission (natural recovery) from untreated depression.

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO and conducted following PRISMA guidelines. EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched, supplemented with an additional hand search to identify studies reporting natural recovery from untreated depression. Study selection and screening were carried out by three independent reviewers. Methodological quality assessment of the included studies was conducted. Remission was defined as no longer meeting the diagnostic criteria or scoring below the cut off points of the validated tools as reported by the included studies. The data were synthesized using narrative summary and random-effects meta-analysis.

Results: Sixteen waitlist-controlled trial studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The duration of follow-up ranged from 4 to 12 weeks with a median duration of 8 weeks. The overall pooled remission from untreated depression was 12.5%, 95% confidence interval (7.8, 18.0%). Due to lack of published data, we were unable to determine if the severity of depression symptoms was associated with remission rates.

Conclusions: Short-term remission from depression without treatment is uncommon. Across studies, 8 â€“ 18% of people remitted without treatment within 12 weeks. Waitlist control groups may not represent all persons with depression.

### Summary of the paper:
<!-- *(in my own words: problem, approach, methods, conclusions as stated by the authors)* -->
-  A meta-analysis examined studies that included participants who were waitlisted and followed-up with for at least 4 weeks. A total of 16 studies were included and the overall pooled estimate of remission among waitlisted participants was 12.5%.

### Summary of what I thought of the paper:
<!-- *(Is it fundamentally sound? Does it uncover anything useful? Did they miss something? What questions are left unanswered?)* -->
- The remission rates were much lower than I had initially thought -- the figure quoted most frequently is ~50% remit within the year without treatment (this number was also referenced in the paper).
- The other numbers that were interesting to me: In general, only 1/3 depressed individuals receive treatment; but within those who do receive treatment, ~50% will remit within the first three months (when not including a timeframe, that estimate goes up to 65% of those receiving treatment will remit).
- This suggests that early treatment is key, but we also have to answer the question of whether there is a selection sample in that those who seek out treatment might be more likely to remit.
