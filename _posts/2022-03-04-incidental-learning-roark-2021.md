# How do we learn _incidentally_?

We learn to speak our native tongue not by explicit instruction, but not via mere passive exposure either. The way we learn to associate experiences and build categories while actively engaged in a separate, primary task is called _incidental learning_. Aside from native language development, many "skills" we acquire fall into this camp. Of interest to me is how we come to recognise, identify, and regulate our emotions and develop unhelpful ways of coping and reacting.

### The representational glue for incidental category learning is alignment with task-relevant behavior

### Summary of what the paper says and does:
*(in my own words: Problem, approach, methods, conclusions as stated by the authors)*
The Premise: how do people learn - passively/implicitly through observing statistical regularities? explicitly through instructions and feedback? in the real world, explicit learning is less common, but learning isn't entirely passive either -- termed incidental learning. That is, you learn associations along the way while you are engaged in a separate task.

Study here was a follow-on from two studies - one a video-game shooting aliens where participants learned sounds predicted which location an alien will appear on screen (hence, fostered game performance but was not vital to task); and then a SMART task which aimed to break down the components of that video game into a more testable/controlled experiment.

Study was to test whether:
- incidental learning happens only with an action/response, or with mere passive observation
- incidental learning happens only with unique responses as opposed to a generic common response
- incidental learning happens as long as there is an association - or whether the information needs to be relevant to the goal at hand

The experiment design:
- on a screen there are 4 grey boxes. A sequence of 5 sounds are played and then an X appears in one of the boxes. There are several conditions:
    - passive: you just hear sounds and see an X, in this condition, the sounds predict location; 
    - generic: you hear sounds that predict location of X and you press spacebar
    - aligned conditions:
        - baseline: you hear sounds that predict location of X - you press the corresponding button (1->d; 2->f; 3->j; 4->k)
        - colour: you hear sounds that predict the colour of X (appears in any box with equal prob) - you press a button that corresponds to colour (green -> d; yellow->f; red->j; blue->k)
    - misaligned condition: you hear sounds that predict the location of the X; but you have to press the button that corresponds to the colour of the X (and colour is random at equal prob) <- so in this condition, the sounds are irrelevant to the task in that it doesn't help you respond faster or better. 
- incidental learning was tested via a generalisation task after; where participants were tested on similar sound and asked to predict location / colour depending on their condition; and also during block 4 where the associations were removed (sound became random and not predictive)

The findings: 
- incidental learning occurred in aligned conditions - where the sound-location or sound-colour association was useful for task performance. 
- incidental learning did not happen in passive or generic action conditions - even though the sound association information was present, because it wasn't "useful" to the task, there was no learning that happened.
- in misaligned trials - same - in that even though the information was there and predictive of location, they were not able to report that association in the generalisation task.


### Summary of what I thought of the paper:
*(Is it fundamentally sound? Does it uncover anything useful? Did they miss something? What questions are left unanswered?)*

First, I thought this was a very well-written paper. Will add this to my library as a reference of good structure and clear writing.

The conditions were also a really useful way for me to think about experiment design because each condition was able to further tease apart certain elements / mechanisms at play.

Takeaway is that even though there are certain associations that can be present and reliable, if they are not deemed "useful" to the task at hand, we ignore them and do not learn those associations.

In relation to depression, anxiety, or even other mental health issues -- this can explain why we do not seem to be able to "see" those other links even if they have been a constant. E.g. if I am anxious, but every time the outcome was "fine", I may not learn and generalise that association because my "task" was to avoid danger rather than to cognitively persuade myself to think differently. So perhaps, this is why in therapy, we try to make those associations explicit, and hence learning does occur. Another thought is where in anxiety - goal can be likened to "avoid danger"; whereas in therapy, the goal is to "reduce anxiety", which is different.

Potential next steps: interesting to use a trial-by-trial approach to see at which point do participants realise that either - sound was useful or sound was NOT useful. I do wonder which one comes first; do we pay attention to all stimuli at the beginning and then weed out what is not relevant, or do we focus solely on the goal at hand and then begin to optimise our behaviour?
