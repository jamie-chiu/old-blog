# What is the Short-Term Remission Rate for Untreated Depression?

One area that I am interested in is the phenomena of spontaneous recovery. Getting data on how often that happens seemed like a good starting point.

### Summary of the paper:
<!-- *(in my own words: problem, approach, methods, conclusions as stated by the authors)* -->
-  A meta-analysis examined studies that included participants who were waitlisted and followed-up with for at least 4 weeks. A total of 16 studies were included and the overall pooled estimate of remission among waitlisted participants was 12.5%.

### Summary of what I thought of the paper:
<!-- *(Is it fundamentally sound? Does it uncover anything useful? Did they miss something? What questions are left unanswered?)* -->
- The remission rates were much lower than I had initially thought -- the figure quoted most frequently is ~50% remit within the year without treatment (this number was also referenced in the paper).
- The other numbers that were interesting to me: In general, only 1/3 depressed individuals receive treatment; but within those who do receive treatment, ~50% will remit within the first three months (when not including a timeframe, that estimate goes up to 65% of those receiving treatment will remit).
- This suggests that early treatment is key, but we also have to answer the question of whether there is a selection sample in that those who seek out treatment might be more likely to remit.
