Hello! This website is an exercise to help myself think clearer and better through writing. I am currently enrolled in a science-writing practicum and this is my way of keeping accountable.

I will be posting summaries of academic papers I read in the realm of depression, computational psychiatry, and change mechanisms. I will also be sharing my personal takeaways from each paper and documenting how my perspectives evolve over time.

Some loosely-articulated questions that I have been thinking about recently (you will see why I desperately need to hone my skill of thinking clearly):

1. What is the trajectory of the development of depression? 
2. Why, if depressed individuals are persistently pessimistic in their expectations, do they not experience / integrate prediction errors?
3. What is the role of the psychotherapist and the therapist-patient relationship on how depressed patients might evaluate themselves and the world?

Thank you for stopping by. I hope you will find something useful here. Feel free to reach out for a chat!
